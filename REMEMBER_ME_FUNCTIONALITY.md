# Remember Me Functionality

## Overview
The Remember Me functionality has been implemented to automatically fill the user's email and password fields when they return to the login page after previously checking the "Remember Me" option.

## How It Works

### Backend Implementation (LoginController.php)

1. **Custom Login Method**: Overrides Laravel's default login method to handle remember me functionality
2. **Credential Storage**: When "Remember Me" is checked, credentials are encrypted and stored in a secure cookie
3. **Credential Retrieval**: When the login form is displayed, stored credentials are decrypted and passed to the view
4. **Security**: Uses Laravel's built-in encryption (`Crypt::encryptString()`) to secure stored credentials

### Frontend Implementation (login.blade.php)

1. **Auto-fill**: JavaScript automatically fills email and password fields with remembered credentials
2. **Checkbox State**: Automatically checks the "Remember Me" checkbox if credentials are found
3. **Local Storage Backup**: Also stores credentials in localStorage as a fallback mechanism
4. **Cleanup**: Clears stored credentials when "Remember Me" is unchecked

## Security Features

- **Encryption**: All stored credentials are encrypted using Laravel's encryption system
- **Cookie Expiration**: Remember me cookies expire after 30 days
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid or corrupted cookies are automatically cleared
- **HTTPS Recommended**: For production, ensure HTTPS is enabled for secure cookie transmission

## User Experience

1. User logs in with "Remember Me" checked
2. Credentials are securely stored
3. On next visit to login page, fields are automatically filled
4. User can simply click "Login" without re-typing credentials
5. User can uncheck "Remember Me" to clear stored credentials

## Technical Details

### Cookie Storage
- Cookie name: `remember_credentials`
- Duration: 30 days
- Encryption: Laravel's `Crypt::encryptString()`

### JavaScript Functions
- `storeCredentialsLocally()`: Stores credentials in localStorage as backup
- `clearStoredCredentials()`: Removes stored credentials
- Auto-fill logic: Checks for backend credentials first, then localStorage fallback

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if encryption/decryption fails
- Console logging for debugging
- Automatic cookie cleanup on errors

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter email and password
3. Check "Remember Me"
4. Submit the form
5. Logout
6. Return to login page
7. Verify fields are auto-filled and checkbox is checked

## Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`: Added remember me logic
- `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`: Added JavaScript for auto-fill
- `routes/web.php`: Updated to use custom authentication routes
